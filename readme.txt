== Description ==

Understand how your leads and customers are participating with your ecommerce system using the WooCommerce - WPMktgEngine extension. It extends the ActivityStream for your lead & customer database within your WPMktgEngine account, so you can see which leads are buying, and ties the order to the lead record.
